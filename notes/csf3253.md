## Chapter 2

- rule-based expert system
- relation, recommendation, directive, strategy, heuristic
- domain expert, knowledge engineer, programmer, project manager, user
- rule, fact, reasoning, inference engine, explanation facilities, user interface
- inference chain, forward chaining, backward chaining
- conflict resolution, priority, specific, recent
- metaknowledge, metarules
- pros
	- natural representation
	- uniform structure
	- separate knowledge from processing
	- deal with incomplete knowledge
- cons
	- conflict in rules
	- ineffective search
	- never learn

## Chapter 3

- fuzzy expert system
- fuzzy = ambiguity
- "micro" "subscript A" (X)
- fuzzy set
	- membership function
	- h**edge**
	- set operation, union, intersection, containment, complement 
- fuzzy rule
	- accept fuzzy value
- ~~wait, that's it?~~ part 2
- fuzzy inference
	- mamdani
	- sugeno - singleton, efficient 
	1. input fuzzification
	2. rule evaluation
	3. rule output aggregation
	4. output defuzzification

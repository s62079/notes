## Fourier Transform

Separate a wave into multiple sine waves. Converts image into frequency domain.

## Filtering

- Notch [^1]: remove certain range of frequency ^34a6b5
- Low-pass / High-pass: low frequency = bright + blur
- Add constant to -pass filter to cherry pick process

### Smoothing Filter

- Ideal: sharp, ring blur
- Butterworth: mid
- Gaussian: smooth, avg blur 

### Homomorphic Filter

Compress light range, improve contrast. Used in **de-blurring**.

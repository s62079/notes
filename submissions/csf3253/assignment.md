## INTRODUCTION

IOT, or Internet of Things, is basically a device on the internet that is capable of sharing and receiving data or instructions through it. By combining a bunch of sensors and devices, we are able to automate a lot of tasks and chores without having to do them ourselves. People often talk about how technology gets better as time passes; it is ironic that this does not happen to be the case on IOT, and security in particular, which is just pathetic.

### Problem Statement

As mentioned, allowing your device to be connected to a network comes with a risk. It is not uncommon to hear news about organizations getting affected by IOT-related incidents, such as a university that had its system hacked by its own vending machines or an electric vehicle that got hacked within 90 seconds using Bluetooth.

There are inherent issues with IOT's security. For example, every IOT device is like a doorway to your home's network; all it takes is a malware-implemented IOT device that you unknowingly connect to your network, which results in a **large attack surface**, and you are now open to any attack executed by the hackers. Not to mention that not every IOT product company has the **time and budget** to implement a solution to the ever-changing standards for IOT. There will always be malicious IOT devices circulating in the market. When facing an IOT-based network attack, most organizations **fail to react on time** due to not constantly monitoring the IOT network. As it is literally automated, nobody can expect when the bad actors decide to make a move.

While industry has been working hard on improving IOT security, the reality is that IOT incidents have been increasing. It is evident that, as of 2023, the IOT malware that was reported surged by 400% compared to last year. As the situation gets worse, the industry should be ready to react to what's to come.

### Proposed Solution 

One of the possible solution for this issue is to integrate the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in IOT security. By implementing features such as pattern recognision on IOT network, AI is able to take action in place of human during an IOT-based attack. Then, the data obtained from the attacks can be used in training the machine learning model used in pattern recognision, further improving its accuracy and effectiveness. 

By allowing AI to **monitor the network** in place of human, you are getting a 24/7 worker that is doing one single job, monitoring the network, analyse every incoming data to look for any sign of malicious attack. When an anomaly is being detected, AI can take action on the spot, **restricting network access** of unauthorized, possible malicious actors from further interacting with the network. Through this combination, the network would now have a **network security** that is always on call, ready to react on any situations.

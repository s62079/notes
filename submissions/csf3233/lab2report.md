	2. make sure your knowledge (security in particular) is always up-to-date 
	3. add security to what you care

	5. don't go to any suspicious websites to begin with

5. Is human behavior is one of the factors of social engineering attack? Explain your answer. 
	- yes, in fact, you don't even have to be skillful on programming or become a geek to gain access to something without permission, all you need is a connection with relevant people, or just lack of sense of security general.
6. How people can be safe from social engineering attacks? 
	- you can't, you can only tell when it happens, and once it happens, it happens. study about the case studies, try to figure things out in general, try to avoid it, and don't feel bad if it actually happens~~, because you're probably fired by your employer at that point anyway.~~

I am Gary Lim, a fresh computer science graduate from University of Malaysia Terengganu. Recently, I have found out that your organization is looking for someone to take the role of corporate communication manager.  I am here to express my interest in taking the role in your organization. 

As a fresh graduate with a degree of computer science, specialized in mobile app development, I have certain degrees of knowledge in terms of technology, which can be good in modernizing the operations of the workspace. Throughout my study, while I am no prodigy, thanks to my ability to focus on things that I am interested in, namely computer science, I have managed to perform well enough in my study through the intense focus and my passion to the subjects. I believe that these properties can also be applied on the job too. Besides that, I am good at adapting to any organization culture in relatively short amount of time, due to having worked in multiple different organizations during semester breaks, it is certainly easier for me to start getting productive in the organization. 

Finally, I am open for any interview sessions, physically or virtually, and I am looking forward for the opportunity and hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely, 
Gary Lim
